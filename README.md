# **My Online Portfolio**

An online portfolio to show my projects and previous work. This portfolio has been built with Vue.js and Bootstrap to make it mobile responsive and Webpack and Babel to ensure it is cross-browser compatible. It is also being developed with accessibility in mind and will be tested with screenreaders and other accessibility tools as it progresses. The portfolio will increase and improve over time as I develop my skills and career further.
